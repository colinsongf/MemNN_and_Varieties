# Memory Networks

This project contains implementations of memory networks.
This includes code in the following subdirectories:


* [MemN2N-lang-model](MemN2N-lang-model): This code trains MemN2N model for language modeling, see Section 5 of the paper "[End-To-End Memory Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08895)". This code is implemented in [Torch7](http://torch.ch/) (written in Lua); more documentation is given in the README in that subdirectory.
 

* [MemN2N-babi-matlab](MemN2N-babi-matlab): The code for the MemN2N bAbI task experiments of Section 4 of the paper:
